# lone-star
Playing with lines and randomness using p5.js and canvas API. Yet another attempt to "Code like no one's watching".

## What is this?

It's been a while since I wanted to play with randomness and drawings. This one is quite a simple experiment with colored bezier lines within a circle.

## Live demo

You can give it a try at https://olivier.audard.net/experiments/lone-star/

## How does it look?

Here is a screenshot, but it's probably better to try it yourself by clicking the link above.

## What about the name?

It's named after _Lone Star_, a song by _Jim Guthrie_ from his _Sword & Sworcery LP_, OST of the eponymous game I played ~10 years ago.
